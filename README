Usage: node pty.js [PORT]

Visit http://localhost:PORT/NAME afterwards in a WebSocket enabled browser.

Default PORT is 8080. NAME you have to choose. Many can connect to the same NAME.


Requirements: Node.js, Python (for proxying PTY), Bash (the terminal started).


WARNING! Still very alpha. If the PORT is public everyone can access your stuff.
